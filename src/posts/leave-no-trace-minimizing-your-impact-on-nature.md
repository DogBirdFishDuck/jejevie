## Leave No Trace: Minimizing Your Impact on Nature

As outdoor enthusiasts, it's our responsibility to protect the natural world we love. By adopting Leave No Trace principles, we can help preserve these precious ecosystems for future generations



### The Seven Principles of Leave No Trace

1. **Plan ahead and prepare:** Research your destination, pack accordingly, and obtain necessary permits.
2. **Travel and camp on durable surfaces:** Avoid fragile areas and stick to designated trails and campsites.
3. **Dispose of waste properly:** Pack out all trash, including food scraps and toilet paper.
4. **Leave what you find:** Resist the urge to collect natural objects.
5. **Minimize campfire impacts:** Use existing fire rings, burn only deadwood, and completely extinguish fires.
6. **Respect wildlife:** Observe from a distance, store food properly, and avoid feeding animals.
7. **Be considerate of other visitors:** Share the outdoors with others and let nature's sounds prevail.
